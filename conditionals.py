# we often ened to make decision based on certain factors
# imagine checking if someone is allowed to ride a rollercoaster:

# are they older than 18?
#   if so, then they can definitely ride it

# In Python
# print('Can you ride this rollercoaster?')
# age = int(input('What is your age?: '))

# if age > 18:
#     print('Definitely!')

# Syntax:
# if condition:
#   Do Stuff
#   Do some more stuff (can have many lines)

# Else statements
print('Can you ride this rollercoaster?')
age = int(input('What is your age?: '))
if age > 18:
    print('Definitely!')
else:
    print('Sorry kid. Come back in a couple of years.')
